
- I'd reccomend watching the video first 

- In case you want to try this you'd need a Gyroscope sensor and an Arduino Leonardo/micro/duo;

      1) Connect your Gyroscope to the Arduino board (you can follow the diagram given, just ommit the blue connection)
      2) Upload the Arduino IDE code given to your board, it should start inmediatly (seldomly you have just to click on the serial monitor for the board to start working)
